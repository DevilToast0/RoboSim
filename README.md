# RoboSim
ASU FSE 100 RoboSim Code. This uses the digital interface of RoboSim (java simulation application)

**Most of the scripts are needed to make the robot work (Libraries), but the main scripts are:**
DADDYSCRIPT.m (main method)
move.m (movement functions)
sensors.m (gets sensor data)
manual.m (allows manual control of robot)
ConnectToEV3.m (connection script)
autonomousScript.m (for blind alleys)
